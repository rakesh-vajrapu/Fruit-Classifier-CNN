# Fruit-Classifier-CNN

• **Developed** a fruit classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented with Keras, achieving a test accuracy of 73.33%.<br/>
• **Utilized** Python programming language along with TensorFlow and Keras deep learning libraries for model development and training.<br/>
• **Conducted** exploratory data analysis on the fruit dataset, comprising six classes: acai, cupuacu, graviola, guarana, pupunha, and tucuma.<br/>
• **Employed** data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shift, and horizontal flipping to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.<br/>
• **Leveraged** tools like ImageDataGenerator for efficient data loading and preprocessing, and utilized techniques like batch normalization and dropout for model regularization.<br/>
• **Implemented** a simple CNN model architecture consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers, with a total of over 59 million trainable parameters.<br/>
• **Trained** the model for 30 epochs, using early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to prevent overfitting and save the best-performing model.<br/>
• **Evaluated** model performance using validation and test datasets, generating a detailed classification report and confusion matrix to assess precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.<br/>
• **Contributed** to the project's success by optimizing hyperparameters, analyzing training curves, and interpreting classification metrics to fine-tune the model for improved accuracy.<br/>
