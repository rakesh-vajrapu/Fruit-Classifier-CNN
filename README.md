# Fruit-Classifier-CNN

• Developed a fruit classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented with Keras, achieving a test accuracy of 73.33%.
• Utilized Python programming language along with TensorFlow and Keras deep learning libraries for model development and training.
• Conducted exploratory data analysis on the fruit dataset, comprising six classes: acai, cupuacu, graviola, guarana, pupunha, and tucuma.
• Employed data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shift, and horizontal flipping to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.
• Leveraged tools like ImageDataGenerator for efficient data loading and preprocessing, and utilized techniques like batch normalization and dropout for model regularization.
• Implemented a simple CNN model architecture consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers, with a total of over 59 million trainable parameters.
• Trained the model for 30 epochs, using early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to prevent overfitting and save the best-performing model.
• Evaluated model performance using validation and test datasets, generating a detailed classification report and confusion matrix to assess precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
• Contributed to the project's success by optimizing hyperparameters, analyzing training curves, and interpreting classification metrics to fine-tune the model for improved accuracy.
