# Fruit Classifier Project

This project aims to classify different types of fruits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with Keras. The classifier can distinguish between various fruits such as acai, cupuacu, graviola, guarana, pupunha, and tucuma.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Project Overview

The fruit classifier project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Analyzing and understanding the fruit dataset.
   - Exploring the distribution of different fruit classes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Resizing and normalizing images.
   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Augmenting the training data to increase model robustness.

3. **Model Development**: 
   - Designing a CNN architecture using Keras.
   - Adding convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
   - Implementing regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization.

4. **Model Training**: 
   - Training the model on the training dataset.
   - Using early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to prevent overfitting and save the best model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluating the trained model on the validation and test datasets.
   - Generating classification reports and confusion matrices to analyze model performance.

## Usage

To run the fruit classifier project:
